# IOT-BASED-CHILD-SAFETY-SYSTEM

This device's objective is to make it easier for a parent or guardian to find their child and ensure their well-being. This system's fundamental working principle entails using sensor nodes to monitor the environment, collecting real-time data and sending that data to a cloud server. Users have access to the data via a web-based interface on the cloud server. In the event that it detects an emergency situation, the wearable can also function to alert the user via a mobile application. The design of this approach entails creating a communication channel between the wearable gadget worn by the child and the parent/guardian.
In order to pinpoint the child's whereabouts in real-time, a GPS module is used to track the child's location. In order to attain similar but diverse findings, we reviewed pertinent publications and discussed about the various approaches that were employed. Later, we compared these articles using their benefits and drew conclusions about their potential applications
